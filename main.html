          <h2>Welcome to the Multitude!</h2>
          <p>Here we shall discuss the effectiveness and strength of our beloved and respected Zayin E.G.O., "Chains of Others".</p>
          <p>It's a 1 Attack Weight ego whose supportive functions mainly shine in Abnormality battles, as the single enemy style combat makes it's downsides negligible in excange for the immense value you get out of it! At uptie 3, Chains of Others inflicts both the user and target with 5 Bind and 3 Attack Power Down, while awarding the user 2 Protection and activating a passive which gives them 3 additional Protection when targeted by at least 3 separate Attack Skills.</p>
          <p>The reason it's utility is so useful in Abnormality fights is that, while your Meursault would be severely restricted in both his speed and clashing ability, none of your other characters suffer the negatives of the E.G.O., which means that, in exchange for one sinner, you've effectively crippled the enemy in such a way, that clashes that would be Struggling or Neutraul suddenly can become Favored, if not Dominant</p>

        <p>Chains of Others is a Zayin E.G.O. in the game "Limbus Company", used by the less-than-enthusiastic frenchman Meursault, it represents the concept of being bound by another's beliefs and expectations by inflicting negative effects (such as Bind and Attack Power Down) on both the enemy targeted by it, and Meursault himself</p>
