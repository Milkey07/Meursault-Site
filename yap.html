          <h2>L'Etranger</h2>
          <p>Meursault, and by extension Chains of Others, is based on the namesake character from Albert Camu's 1942 Novel, "The Stranger". The representation of Meursault in Limbus Company attempts to pay homage to the character through their new interpretation.</p>
          <p>The E.G.O. itself takes inspiration of the latter part of the book, in which Meursault is imprisoned for the murder of a man. More specifically, it represents the way the trial took place. A mockery of legal defense, which had focused not on the crime committed, nor its victim, but Meursault himself and the kind of person he is. His lack of outward empathy, the less than favorable friends he has hung out with, and the seemingly premeditated steps that had lead him to the murder. The focus on his character, instead of crime, deeply frustrated Meursault, as in the end, he was condemned to the gallows not because of his murder of an innocent man, but for the way he carried himself in his everyday life</p>
          <p>The book has strong themes of judgement, and the danger someone who doesn't share the populi's common values is often seen as a danger. Meursault is bound and imprisoned as he must either bow and follow rules that feel antithetical to his very being, or be sent to the gallows for his refusal of them.</p>

        <p>Chains of Others is a Zayin E.G.O. in the game "Limbus Company", used by the less-than-enthusiastic frenchman Meursault, it represents the concept of being bound by another's beliefs and expectations by inflicting negative effects (such as Bind and Attack Power Down) on both the enemy targeted by it, and Meursault himself</p>
